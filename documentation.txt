note: TSLint has been the recommended linter in the past,
 but now TSLint is deprecated and ESLint is taking over its duties.

Migration to ESLint: The TypeScript team officially recommends migrating from TSLint to ESLint for TypeScript projects.

use Stylelint + Prettier (Stylelint or Sass Lint)

1- PS C:\projects\weave-wider\es-lint-demo> npm install --save-dev eslint
(Itâ€™s important to include the --save-dev flag because this saves the package as a dependency for development usage only.)

2-PS C:\projects\weave-wider\es-lint-demo> .\node_modules\.bin\eslint --init
You can also run this command directly using 'npm init @eslint/config@latest'.

3-select options that met your project.

4-eslint.config.mjs are generated automatically.

5-add prettier and eslint extension

6-  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "eslint": "eslint"
  },

  add "eslint" to scripts in package.json

7-in command line enter ( npm run eslint );

in vscode ==> open settings.json add this code ==>
{
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    },
    "eslint.validate": ["javascript"]
}
With this code in your settings.json file, ESLint will now automatically correct errors and validate JavaScript on save.

8-can include eslint wokflow in case to ensure the bugy code not merged to main branch.
